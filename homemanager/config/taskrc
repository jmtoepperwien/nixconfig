# Taskwarrior program configuration file.
# For more documentation, see https://taskwarrior.org or try 'man task', 'man task-color',
# 'man task-sync' or 'man taskrc'

# Here is an example of entries that use the default, override and blank values
#   variable=foo   -- By specifying a value, this overrides the default
#   variable=      -- By specifying no value, this means no default
#   #variable=foo  -- By commenting out the line, or deleting it, this uses the default

# You can also refence environment variables:
#   variable=$HOME/task
#   variable=$VALUE

# Use the command 'task show' to see all defaults and overrides

# Files
data.location=/home/mtoepperwien/.task

# To use the default location of the XDG directories,
# move this configuration file from ~/.taskrc to ~/.config/task/taskrc and uncomment below

#data.location=~/.local/share/task
#hooks.location=~/.config/task/hooks
