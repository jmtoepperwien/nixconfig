# NixOS Configuration

Hi there,  
this is my NixOS configuration which I am using for my Desktop, Notebook, Server and sometimes my Raspberry Pis.  
Feel free to use code from here (MIT License), ask questions or even suggest changes.

The code here is not clean(!), but it works. Maybe this will be subject to rewriting in the future.
